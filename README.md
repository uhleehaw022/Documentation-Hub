# Documentation Hub Portfolio: Confluence Implementation

## Challenge
Policies, SOPs, and guides were scattered, inconsistent, outdated, and hard for the team to follow, making compliance and onboarding inefficient.

## Solution

- Standardized formats and workflows to ensure consistency and ease of updates.

## Impact
- Improved compliance and audit readiness
- Faster task completion and onboarding for new staff
- Reduced errors and miscommunication
